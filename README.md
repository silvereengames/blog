# Blog
If you want to deploy it you can use this as a template for your own blog

Just type `npx @11ty/eleventy` in the root to build, all posts are in the posts directory, and change the .md file to change the home page

This is a WIP (work in progress), all css is going to be re-done as well as better docs.
