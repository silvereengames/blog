Jeeez! Lately ive been doing a LOT of reasearch into open source server management dashboards and I have found some really powerful dashboards but the only issue is,
some of these dashboards have more features than others. WHY! Its like I find this really powerful one I really love but it has literally EVERYTHING except the ONE thing
I need. The best control panel ive used to date with all features I need would be cPanel & WHM but they are all so damn expensive. Im not trying to pay $15 - $20 a month.


Someone really needs to just create a damn contol panel that can do EVERYTHING.
